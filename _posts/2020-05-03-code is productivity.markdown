```python
print("Hello Word! With my codes.")
```

In crypto world, people always says that 

> Code is law.

After I learn from the crypto market and stock market in the past 5 years, I believe that:

> Code is productivity.
>
> Code is MONEY.
>
> Code makes money.

Human beings are heading into the Cyberspace rapidly with the developing of blockchain and decentralized technology, as well as the way making money.

QUANT + program trading + blockchain tech are the future of FinTech.

Therefore I rebuild this blog to log the rapid developing of them and my study on them.
